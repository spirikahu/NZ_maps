# NZ Maps

The following code can be used in order plot a simple choropleth map of NZ (or parts of NZ) from the MB2013_HD_Clipped.shp shape file provided from [Statistics NZ](http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/Maps_and_geography/Geographic-areas/digital-boundary-files.aspx). This file can be found under the header census-based files, ESRI shapefiles and New Zealand 2013(NZTM). Due to the size of this data file it is not hosted here along with the code and must be downloaded seprately. 

I also make use of the NZ 2013 census data (also provided by Statistics NZ, but hosted here with the code) to explore how the median personal income differs over different suburbs in the cities Palmerston North and Christchurch. I choose Palmerston North and Christchurch simply because they are the two places I have called home over the last several years.
